Problem: Goal is to identify what is wrong with the code and what you suggest to change for it

-- not good practice to not write primary key and NOT Null, it is important to write that. Need to end it with a semicolon
CREATE TABLE FirstTab (
     id integer, 
     name VARCHAR(10)
) 

--
INSERT INTO FirstTab VALUES
(5,'Pawan'),
(6,'Sharlee'),
(7,'Krish'),
(NULL,'Avtaar')


-- need to end it with the semicolon
SELECT * FROM FirstTab

CREATE TABLE SecondTab (
    id integer 
)

INSERT INTO SecondTab VALUES
(5),
(NULL)

- need to end it with semicolon 
SELECT * FROM SecondTab


Questions: What is the output of each one?
1.SELECT COUNT(*) FROM FirstTab AS ft WHERE ft.id NOT IN ( SELECT id FROM SecondTab WHERE id = 5 );
Output = 2 
2.SELECT COUNT(*) FROM FirstTab AS ft WHERE ft.id NOT IN ( SELECT id FROM SecondTab WHERE id IS NULL );
Output = 0 
3.SELECT COUNT(*) FROM FirstTab AS ft WHERE ft.id NOT IN ( SELECT id FROM SecondTab )
Output = 0 
4.SELECT COUNT(*) FROM FirstTab AS ft WHERE ft.id NOT IN ( SELECT id FROM SecondTab WHERE id IS NOT NULL )
Output = 2
