#Exercise1
Print the following output in one line of code:
Hello world
Hello world
Hello world
Hello world
I love python
I love python
I love python
I love python

What we know:
1. Each sentence should be on a different line. 
2. Each sentence is unique.

Solution:

print('\n'.join([line for line in ['Hello world'] * 4 + ['I love python'] * 4]))

Explained:

This line works as a line comprehension to accomplish those tasks in one line. "/n" works as a element to add a new line, and the ".join" acts an element to add the "Hello World" and "I love Python" strings together.  
The multiplication sign acts as a way to identify the amount of times the function should go through.


#Exercise2 
Ask the user to input a month (1 to 12).
Display the season of the month received :
Spring runs from March (3) to May (5)
Summer runs from June (6) to August (8)
Autumn runs from September (9) to November (11)
Winter runs from December (12) to February (2)

What we know:
1. Asks for the users input
2. Using if and else statements

Solution:
month = int(input("Enter a month (1 to 12): "))

if month >= 3 and month <= 5:
    season = "Spring"
elif month >= 6 and month <= 8:
    season = "Summer"
elif month >= 9 and month <= 11:
    season = "Autumn"
elif month == 12 or month <= 2:
    season = "Winter"
else:
    season = "Invalid month"

print(season)

Explained
1. Uses Else/If/elif statements to categorize what the output would be.
