#Exercise1
Print the following output in one line of code:
Hello world
Hello world
Hello world
Hello world
I love python
I love python
I love python
I love python

What we know:
1. Each sentence should be on a different line. 
2. Each sentence is unique.

Solution:

print('\n'.join([line for line in ['Hello world'] * 4 + ['I love python'] * 4]))

Explained:

This line works as a line comprehension to accomplish those tasks in one line. "/n" works as a element to add a new line, and the ".join" acts an element to add the "Hello World" and "I love Python" strings together.  
The multiplication sign acts as a way to identify the amount of times the function should go through.
